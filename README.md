# African-Economies-Debt-Data-Analysis
In the past 20 years, China has poured in upwards of $150 billion into African nations for Infrastructure, Resources and Agricultural projects. These funds have given the economies a great boost but they come with their costs. Our analysis looks at the boost to development caused by these investments and the impact of such high loans on the countries' economies


## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
China has loaned heavily to African countries over the past 20 years for the Transportation, Agriculture, Education, Health, Water and Resources sectors. What particular KPIs are influencing these countries’ GDP with high amount of debt? Are the Chinese loans truly helping these countries?

## METHODOLOGY
### Step 1: METHODOLOGY 
Experimenting and trying to understand how world bank collects data

### Step 2: EDA
Generating unique visualizations to understand loans for highly indebted countries

### Step 3: MODEL EVALUATION
hoosing model and key indicator to determine model performance

### Step 4: MODEL CONCLUSION/KEY TAKEAWAYS
Deciding what the model tells us and the effect of China loans

# THE STORY
The top nations that have received the most money from China are a good representation of the impact these loans can have on a country's development.  
Therefore, we're going to be using these countries for our analysis from this point on, specifically Angola.

# WHY ANGOLA IS INTERESTING TO US?
Out of the $153 billion that China has poured into Africa, ~30% of that has gone to Angola.  
Angola was one of the first nations to receive funding and that puts them in an interesting spot for our analysis.  
The loans to Angola have plateaued over the past 5 years while the funding from China has not slowed down.   
This puts Angola ahead of other African nations in the cycle of loans -> Development and repayment. Making it a compelling case for our analysis.  

# IMPACT OF SPECIFIC SECTOR LOANS ON DEVELOPMENT METRICS OF ANGOLA 
## AGRICULTURE LOANS
Over the past 20 years, these amount to a total of $5 billion. The metrics that show the impact of loans in this sector are:  
‘Arable land as a % of Total Land’ and  
‘Employment rate in Agriculture as % of total employment’  
These metrics best show the impact these loans have had on the Agricultural sector of Angola  

## TRANSPORTATION LOANS
Over the past 20 years, these amount to a total of $1.2 billion. The metrics that show the impact of loans in this sector is  
‘Poverty headcount ratio’  
Better transportation leads to urbanization, higher trade and more jobs and hence this metric best shows the impact of transportation loans  

As transportation loans have gone up the poverty headcount ratio has declined but this too is showing signs of slowing down. The last loan in the transport sector has had little to no impact on the poverty headcount ratio of Angola. There is not enough data to prove this hypothesis but after looking at similar data from other sectors we are not optimistic about this rate of decline of poverty with increasing loans.
